## Starting a Project
- [x] Overview
- [x] Specification Documentation
- [x] Does it hold money?
    - The contract facilitates the transfer of SNT from a sticker buyer to a sticker artist.
    - It does not hold value.
    - [x] how much?**
        - N/A.
    - [x] who controls it?**
        - Status is the controller. 
    - [x] how complex is its flow?**
        - The sticker buyer signs a tx to transfer money, then the contract transfers that to the artist. It's two transactions with one signature.
    - [x] is it locked up for a period of time ever?**
        - Not really. The transactions should happen instantaneously. 
- [x] How many smart contracts should it take to complete?**
    - One smart contract, the registry. 
    - [x] How complex is their interaction?**
        - This is n/a at the moment.
- [x] Is this project core to your business model?
    - Yes, because it's a potentially high Tx volume SNT utility.
    - [x] Does it control finances?
        - No.
    - [x] Does it influence user adoption?
        - The feature aims at increasing engagement. In the future the option to gift stickers could be used to reach outside of the network and bring new users in. 
    - [x] Does it lock up significant portions of your assets?
        - No. Status is not holding any assets in the sticker market. The cost of a pack of stickers should hover around $2, and a buyer's funds are not locked, but transfered to the sticker artist. 
    - [x] Is it unique to your business?
        - Yes, only in that no other sticker market is backed by tokens. Our business model is dependent on flow of SNT, not taking proceeds from each sale. 100% of sales go to the artists. Otherwise, it mirrors a traditional sticker market. 
- [x] How many users will it have?
    - [x] Upon its deployment to mainnet?
        - It's directly integrated within chat, Status' most obvious feature. Assuming that stickers see popularity similar to that of other apps, this could mean anywhere from 10-20% of the userbase uses stickers? 
            - _FB messenger has 1.5B users and 380 million stickers sent per day. Assuming sticker users are sending on average 2 per day, that means approx. 16% of their users are sending them._  
        - Our beta userbase is < 10k users.
    - [x] Over time?
        - [x] How does its footprint on the blockchain grow?**
            - Storage growth is only in the ERC721 storage. 
- [x] How many types of users will it have?
    - Two: buyers and creator/sellers. The seller of a pack can be different than the creator. For instance, I might publish a pack to the marketplace but send SNT for its sales to another person's address. 
    - [ ] Have you detailed their abilities within the project explicitely?
- [x] How complex is the front end?
    - Not very.
    - [x] Is the FE's sole purpose to interact with the contract(s)?
        - Yes.
- [x] Does it intergrate with other things?
    - It integrates with status-react. In the UI, the only entry point to the feature is currently through a message draft in chat, or through receiving a sticker from another user. It opens a panel to the marketplace, and stickers can be sent in private, group and public chats. The feature is limited to the context of chat.
- [x] Will it need to be upgraded?**
    - [x] How often**
        - Hard to predict.
    - [x] How complex is the migration to (a) new contract(s)?**
        - Dependent upon upgrade requirements. 
- [x] Does it have novel/complex cryptography or math functions?**
    - Math: Percentage calculation

## Wrapping up a Project
- [x] Have you run analyzers on the contracts?
    - Yes
    - [x] Which ones?
        - `slither@0.6.4`, current output in `./analyzers/slither/`
        - `embark-graph@4.0.2`, current output in `./analyzers/embark-graph/`
    - [x] Where are the resutls and their response write-ups?
- [x] Has the specification sheet been updated throughout the project?
    - [ ] How often?
        not sure @Rachel?
- [x] Have you performed any STRIDE sessions to hunt for vulnerabilities?
    - No.
- [x] Has it been tested on a testnet?
    - It has been tested manually once. More manual testing is planned to check for regressions, bugs.
    - [ ] What are the contract details for these deployments?
- [x] Has it gone through an internal stress test?
    - No.
- [x] Is the front-end completed?
    - Yes.
- [x] Do you have an upgrade or succession plan in place?
    - One of the following:
        - New contract can be independent and older simply becomes view only. 
        - New contract can be owner of the older contract which would be used only as ledger (by using generateToken function).
        - New contract can be owner of current contract and migrate on demand to new contract ledger. (e.g. when a transfer is requested)
- [x] Is front-running a potential problem?
    - Unsure: we request all stickers packs from contract, we buy a pack, and we check if pack is owned by user.

These notes are used to prepare for a formal audit, and should be performed before engaging an external professional.  By not doing them, you are wasting time and money.
