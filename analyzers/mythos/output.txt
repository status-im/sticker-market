Title: (SWC-107) Reentrancy
Severity: Medium
Head: A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
Description: The callee address of an external message call can be set by the caller. Note that the callee can contain arbitrary code and may re-enter any function in this contract. Review the business logic carefully to prevent averse effects on the contract state.

Title: (SWC-110) Assert Violation
Severity: Low
Head: A reachable exception has been detected.
Description: It is possible to trigger an exception (opcode 0xfe). Exceptions can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.
